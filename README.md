## Hi there👋
I am Michele Zhu, a PhD Candidate at Politecnico di Milano. I'm passionate about programming, AI/ML, and software performance. 

## Programming Languages
The main programming languages that I know, in order of proficiency:
1. Python
2. C++
3. MATLAB

But really, it's only the main ones I've played with C, Java, CUDA, C#, and so on.

Update: 13/10/2025 My personal webpage is under maintenance.
